# Purpose
Eric's Simple Content Admin (or ESCA, if that isn't already a thing) is a simple bit of PHP code (currently 2 classes) allowing web developers to (very easily) add WYSIWYG editing for their clients. The goal is for ESCA to eventually provide all the functionality you'd need for a well built informational website, with additional features to make a site more interactive.

# How to use
Currently there is no documentation, but index.php provides a well-commented example.
Consider this project to be in beta stage. While I'm pretty certain it's safe to use, you should review the source code if this is for your boss's website. I am not responsible if using the given work allows somebody to exploit your server.

# Features
## Current Features
 - [x] Uses PHP's newer mysqli library
 - [x] Boxes of content called "blips", which become editable in edit mode
 - [x] Rich text editor (using nicEdit library)

 - [ ] Loading configuration from ini files
 
## Contributing
If you have a feature idea, don't like the way I coded something, or anything else like that, awesome! Please let me know in issues. If you want to contribute code, make sure it's either a bug fix, in the upcoming features list, or that you've posted an idea for a feature and I have seen it.

# License
I'd like to give credit to nicEdit, which is the JavaScript library used for creating rich text editors when ESCA is in edit mode.
This program is under the â˜º licence. This basically means you can do whatever with the code under the condition of being nice to somebody. (best software licence ever)
